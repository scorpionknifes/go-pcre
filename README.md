## History

This is a clone of [go-pcre](https://github.com/rubrikinc/goc-pcre)

This was a clone of [golang-pkg-pcre](http://git.enyo.de/fw/debian/golang-pkg-pcre.git) by Florian Weimer, which has been placed on Github by Glenn Brown, so it can be fetched automatically by Go's package installer.

Glenn Brown added `FindIndex()` and `ReplaceAll()` to mimic functions in Go's default regexp package.

Mathieu Payeur Levallois added `Matcher.ExtractString()`.

Malte Nuhn added `GroupIndices()` to retrieve positions of a matching group.

Chandra Sekar S added `Index()` and stopped invoking `Match()` twice in `FindIndex()`.

Misakwa added support for `pkg-config` to locate `libpcre`.

Yann Ramin added `ReplaceAllString()` and changed `Compile()` return type to `error`.

Nikolay Sivko modified `name2index()` to return error instead of panic.

Harry Waye exposed raw `pcre_exec`.

Hazzadous added partial match support.

Pavel Gryaznov added support for JIT compilation.
